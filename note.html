1. I started learning alpine JS from Traversy media YT channel
x-data, x-on, x-on:click, x-text, x-show, x-cloak(which is used inside the style element)
we use x-transition besides the x-show for smoother transition
x-effects: x-effect="console.log(open)", alert(open), 
x-bind: x-bind:class="open ? 'bg-blue-800': 'bg-slate-700' " This will toggle the class open by changing the colors when clicked.
and it will still work if we remove the x-bind but leave alone the : 
2. the next thing I am learning is the x-model, I first added search attribute to x-data and give it an empty string as the value. and then I set x-model="search", The teacher mentioned it's similar to ng model
3.  the next is the x-if and the x-for attributes 
4. the next is the x-ref attribute with which we can access elements directly. we can use this magic property with div, input, button etc. and we can change their properties using the syntax ("$refs.element.property_we_want_to_change=value")
I included the axios script tag so I can use it together with the x-html attribute to link to another file.
the next magic property besides $refs is $el, $el is used to accesss the current property, $refs can be used to access any properties.
there's x-init which fires up a javascript once initialized. and we can use this with $watch to watch our post in this kind of syntax x-init="$watch('posts', value => console.log(value))" , the watch is very good for watching over an event.
the next is $dispatch, the teacher mentioned that it's a shortcut for dispatching browser events.
the next magic property is $data, it's very useful if there's a javascript file outside that I want to access, I can acess and use it with the $data magic properties.
the next one is store, which is how to store data on the client side.
